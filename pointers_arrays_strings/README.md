## Project Overview

This project introduces three major concepts in C programming:

1. **Pointers** – variables that store memory addresses  
2. **Arrays** – collections of elements of the same data type  
3. **Strings** – arrays of characters ending with a null terminator (`'\0'`)

By the end of the project, I should be able to:

- Explain what pointers are and how they are used
- Work with arrays and understand how they relate to memory
- Manipulate strings using pointer notation
- Distinguish between pointers and arrays
- Understand and apply variable scope

## Compilation

All code is compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
