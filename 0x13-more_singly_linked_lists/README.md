## 📚 Description
This project focuses on implementing and mastering singly linked lists in C.

We manually build common linked list operations such as:

- printing nodes
- counting nodes
- adding nodes (beginning & end)
- deleting nodes
- inserting nodes
- reversing lists
- handling loops safely
- freeing memory properly

This strengthens understanding of:

- pointers
- dynamic memory (malloc/free)
- data structures
- memory safety
- algorithm thinking
